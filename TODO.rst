- Rename ValueMeta/ValueABC --> TypeCheckable and TypeCheckable
    - Will require changing imports from sibling packages (clswrap and metatype)
- Decide if ABCView should actually be located inside ducktype.
- metatypes/ needs unittests. Also... test inheritance.
- Have metatypes/ use metaclasses (maybe ValueMeta), so that Union() produces classes, not instances (and issubclass(Union(list, tuple), collections.Sequence) becomes valid). Perhaps this can be done via __new__ instead of metaclasses.
